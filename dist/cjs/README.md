TypeScript/JavaScript library for Yoctopuce devices
===================================================
(exported as a CommonJS module)

## What is this library good for ?

This library provides access to [Yoctopuce devices](https://www.yoctopuce.com) 
for TypeScript and JavaScript environments leveraging Node.js traditional
CommonJS modules. It can be used with all kind of TypeScript, JavaScript
and ECMAScript environments, including in browsers, Node.js services and 
Electron or similar software.

This library handles asynchronous communication with the devices using Promise objects, 
leveraging the new EcmaScript 2017 `async` / `await` non-blocking syntax for asynchronous I/O.
The source code of this library is originally written in TypeScript.

In order to keep your package repository small, the
`yoctolib-cjs` package only includes the transpiled files and the
type definition files, for consumption as a CommonJS module.

You will find the full TypeScript source code, as well as usage examples,
in the zipped library on [Yoctopuce web site](https://www.yoctopuce.com/EN/libraries.php)
and on [GitHub](https://github.com/yoctopuce/yoctolib_ts).
